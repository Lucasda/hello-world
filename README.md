Hello Everyone,

I like programming in various languages. I have been writing software for clients since the early 90's. Initially in VOS for voicemail systems, and paging companies. I've mostly written desktop applications and complete office automations applications. I currently trying to get a strong handle on web and mobile apps. Looking foward to feedback so I can get better.

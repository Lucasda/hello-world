Hello Everyone,

I like programming in various languages. I have been writing software for clients since the early 90's. Initially in VOS for voicemail systems, and paging companies. I've written in unix, dBase,  VB, VB.NET, Flash, AS3, SQL, PHP, HTML, Javascript, and Jquery. I've mostly written desktop applications and complete office automations applications. I'm currently trying to get a strong handle on web and mobile app developement to create SAAS applications. Looking foward to feedback so I can get better as a developer and solution provider.
